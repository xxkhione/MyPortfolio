                <h2>War Card Game App</h2>
                <p>During my first quarter at Neumont College of Computer Science, I took Intro to Computer Science.
                    This class expanded a little further than the knowledge I went in with. We worked with Android Studio
                    and Java to create event driven applications. During the fourth week, the class was assigned a "create 
                    you own app" lab. I decided to recreate War the card game. I used imageViews to create the cards as 
                    well as buttons and game logic to tie it all together.
